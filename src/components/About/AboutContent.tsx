          Hey there! I'm Moises, a BSIT student who loves turning ideas into
          real, usable products. I'm a big fan of accessibility and performance.
          Lately, I've been exploring Next.js, end-to-end testing, and the
          concept of cloud computing. Outside of coding, you'll probably find me
          checking out new tech tools, listening to music and watching films.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations. So, if you have
          something in mind, let's build it together!
